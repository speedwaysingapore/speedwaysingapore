# Update about my Scratch account and me.

Hello Scratchers and legends. You may have been wondering: "Where is Knightbot63?", "Is he dead?" Well, the answer to that is simple...<br>
<br>First, I am not dead. I am still working on an RPG called "The Demon Soul" after 10 months of first announce.
<br>Second, I am inactive on Scratch because of the RPG. Any other person saying that I am inactive because I am banned is lying. 
# RPG Status and Other Games

As of 2023 of September, Stickman Quest is no longer being worked on. No, the project file will not be posted anywhere at all.

<br>**The Demon Soul (RPG) has been worked on for the past year, I am happy that I am working on it. However, I am having struggles doing so...  The main struggle are 2 things:**
- Music Composing
- Artist<br><br>

**Music composing is alright. However, I can't seem to get the tone of the music for the maps and miscellaneous things. I'm only good at sound effects and not music. You'll most likely hear music from different games instead of my own. Preferably, for ears sake.** <br><br>
**For art, I am decent at the pixel art. It isn't the best but it is good enough that the basic player can enjoy. Some arts will be from different games. Credits will be into there.** <br><br>


# Other
My music is made in FamiTracker 2a03 + VRC6 ~+ SunSoft 5B

I still remember the time where I made my first pixel art. It was a simple chocolate bar for a shooter game, though it wasn't fitting whatsoever. And then I thought, why not have this as an item in an RPG of some sorts?

# Scratch Account
I am not as active as I was on Scratch. I am mainly active on blue robot logo website/app. For any miscellaneous things that aren't related to my Scratch account, please contact me on GitHub and/or the app I said above. Please use the app I said above due to inactivity on GitHub.<br><br>

Thank you for understanding and reading. Please reach out on the blue robot site of the username *rad7cal*.
