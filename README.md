I moved out of Scratch and went to HTML, CSS, Python, and potetionally more.

My Scratch account is [Knightbot63](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Knightbot63) where I *used to* post most of my things.

# What I'm working On
Main focus now is Lightflow. A social media website for everyone!

I have 9th grade soon :/
